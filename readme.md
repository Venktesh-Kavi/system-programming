This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my learning materials, proofs of concept, and projects related to programming and software development. 

Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

learnings
This directory contains notes, markdown files, and code snippets related to various learning topics. It is further subdivided into subdirectories based on specific subjects:

bit-manipulation : concepts of left and right shift operators.
clean-code: notes from uncle bob's Clean Code [WIP].
databases : Explores various database systems, SQL querying, database design, and related topics.
pocs (Proofs of Concept)
The pocs directory houses implementations and experiments related to system programming and design patterns. It serves as a playground for exploring new ideas and techniques before incorporating them into larger projects. It contains the following subdirectories:

system-programming : Includes projects and examples related to system programming concepts, such as file I/O, memory management, and low-level programming.
design-patterns : Contains implementations and examples of various design patterns, demonstrating their practical applications.
projects
This directory is dedicated to hosting my various programming projects. It includes a diverse range of applications, tools, and utilities developed using different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. Each project has its own subdirectory and a corresponding README.md file with details about the project, its purpose, and usage instructions.
